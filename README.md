# Netflix-Data-Content-Based-Filtering
This is a trivial implementation of content based filtering, user inputs. 
Using cosine similarity to compare the 'closeness'/how similar the input is to the corpus. 

Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space
that measures the cosine of the angle between them.

Special Mention:
